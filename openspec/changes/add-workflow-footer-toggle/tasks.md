## 1. Implementation

- [ ] 1.1 Add research note documenting design choice and constraints
- [ ] 1.2 Update webview Workflow component to render a footer button only when expanded
- [ ] 1.3 Ensure footer/header are visually consistent, with symmetric separators (top uses existing divider; footer adds a bottom divider)

## 2. Validation

- [ ] 2.1 Unit tests: patch marker bump + footer presence in injected patch
- [ ] 2.2 Local dry-run verify against installed extension artifacts
