Webview patch (injected into installed webview bundle `webview/assets/index-*.js`)

Purpose:
- Fold per-turn process items into a single expandable `Workflow` row so the final answer stays clean.
- Project-scoped thread list (new):
  - When `codex.workflow.threadScope = "workspace"` (default),
    filter `thread/list` results to only include threads whose `cwd` is inside the
    current VS Code workspace roots injected by the host meta tag:
    `codex-workflow-workspace-roots`
  - Set `codex.workflow.threadScope = "all"` to disable filtering.

Verification marker:
- The patched file must contain the string: `CODEX_WORKFLOW_FOLD_PATCH_V19`

Notes:
- Some older threads may store `cwd` as a `file://` URI (e.g. `file:///d%3A/...`).
  The patch normalizes URIs to paths before matching against workspace roots.

Implementation source of truth:
- `tools/workflow-fold/patcher.mjs` (search for `CODEX_WORKFLOW_FOLD_PATCH`)
