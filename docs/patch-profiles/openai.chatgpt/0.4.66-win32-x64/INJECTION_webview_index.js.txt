Webview patch (injected into installed webview bundle `webview/assets/index-*.js`)

Purpose:
- Add a synthetic `workflow` item per turn that groups all “process items” between:
  - `user-message` (start of turn)
  - `assistant-message` (final answer)
- Render `workflow` as a clickable header (fold/unfold), with:
  - status: `Working` / `Done`
  - timer: updates every 1s while running
- Preserve original rendering of children when expanded.

Key behaviors:
- If `codex.workflow.collapseByDefault` is:
  - `disable`: do nothing (upstream behavior)
  - `collapse`: show Workflow, default folded
  - `expand`: show Workflow, default expanded
- Detects mode from:
  `<meta name="codex-workflow-collapse" content="...">`
  (injected by the host patch, based on VS Code settings; defaults to `"collapse"` if unset/invalid)

Verification marker:
- The patched file must contain the string: `CODEX_WORKFLOW_FOLD_PATCH_V10`

Injected patch code is owned by this repo and can be reviewed in:
- `tools/workflow-fold/patcher.mjs` (search for `CODEX_WORKFLOW_FOLD_PATCH`)
