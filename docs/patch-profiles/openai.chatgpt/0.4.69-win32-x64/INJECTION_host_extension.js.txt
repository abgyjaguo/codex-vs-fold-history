Host patch (injected into installed extension `out/extension.js`)

Purpose:
- Read VS Code settings and inject per-webview `<meta>` tags into the Codex webview HTML:
  - `codex.workflow.collapseByDefault = "collapse" | "expand" | "disable"`
  - `codex.workflow.threadScope = "workspace" | "all"`
- Provide workspace context to the webview:
  - Collect current `workspaceFolders[].uri.fsPath`
  - Inject as `codex-workflow-workspace-roots` (URL-encoded JSON array)
- Persist per-turn Workflow timers locally (host `globalState`) for keys prefixed with:
  - `codex.workflow.timer.`

Injected markers:
- Host patch marker: `CODEX_WORKFLOW_FOLD_HOST_V8`
- Meta tags injected into HTML `<head>`:
  - `<meta name="codex-workflow-collapse" content="...">`
  - `<meta name="codex-workflow-thread-scope" content="...">`
  - `<meta name="codex-workflow-workspace-roots" content="...">`

Implementation source of truth:
- `tools/workflow-fold/patcher.mjs` (`patchExtensionHostJs`)
